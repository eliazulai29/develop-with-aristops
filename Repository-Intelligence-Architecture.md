# Repository Intelligence Architecture: Beyond Cursor & Windsurf

## üéØ Vision Statement

Build an AI-powered coding assistant that surpasses Cursor and Windsurf by implementing a **Repository Contract System** with **Progressive Intelligence Loading** and **Deep Repository DNA Analysis**.

---

## üîç Current Challenge Analysis

### The Problem with Current Approach
- **Generic Responses**: Chat provides FastAPI tutorials instead of repository-specific guidance
- **Missing Context**: LLM doesn't understand repository structure before answering
- **No Progressive Intelligence**: All-or-nothing context loading leads to token limit issues
- **Lack of Repository DNA**: No understanding of coding patterns, architectural decisions, or project-specific conventions

### Root Cause Identified
```
User Request: "Add health check endpoint to FastAPI"
Current Flow: RAG Query ‚Üí Random health check examples ‚Üí Generic tutorial response
Needed Flow: Repository Intelligence ‚Üí Specific file analysis ‚Üí Exact implementation guidance
```

## üîÑ Multi-Pass Progressive Repository Intelligence

### The Batch Processing Challenge

**Problem**: Large repositories require batch processing due to LLM token limits, but this creates fragmented understanding where relationships between files in different batches are lost.

```
‚ùå Current Problematic Approach:
Batch 1: [auth.py, login.py] ‚Üí Partial Contract A
Batch 2: [routes.py, api.py] ‚Üí Partial Contract B  
Batch 3: [models.py, db.py] ‚Üí Partial Contract C
Final: Try to merge A + B + C ‚Üí Inconsistent Contract

Problems:
- routes.py uses patterns from auth.py but they're in different batches
- Repository DNA changes as more patterns are discovered
- Early contracts become outdated by later findings
- Relationships between components are lost
```

### ‚úÖ Solution: 4-Pass Architecture for Contract Building

#### **Pass 1: Discovery Pass (Structural Skeleton)**
*Purpose: Map the entire repository structure quickly*

```python
# Process ALL files in small chunks for basic structure only
for batch in create_discovery_batches(all_files, chunk_size=50):
    structural_data = await baml_client.ExtractStructure(
        files=batch,
        extract_only=["imports", "exports", "class_names", "function_names", "file_types"]
    )
    repository_skeleton.update(structural_data)

# Output: Complete dependency graph, module structure, entry points
```

**BAML Function for Discovery:**
```python
function ExtractStructure(files: string[]) -> RepositoryStructure {
  client "CustomGPT4oMini"  # Fast, cheap model
  prompt #"
    Extract ONLY structural information from these files:
    - File type and purpose
    - Import/export statements  
    - Class and function names (no implementation details)
    - Module dependencies
    
    Focus on STRUCTURE, not implementation details.
    {{ ctx.output_format }}
    Files: {{ files }}
  "#
}
```

#### **Pass 2: Relationship Mapping (Smart Batching)**
*Purpose: Group related files and understand relationships*

```python
# Use skeleton to create intelligent batches of related files
relationship_batches = create_smart_batches(
    repository_skeleton,
    strategy="group_by_dependencies"  # Files that import each other
)

for batch in relationship_batches:
    relationships = await baml_client.AnalyzeRelationships(
        files=batch.files,
        context=repository_skeleton,
        focus="component_interactions"
    )
    relationship_graph.update(relationships)
```

**Smart Batching Strategy:**
```python
def create_smart_batches(skeleton, strategy):
    if strategy == "group_by_dependencies":
        # Group files that import each other
        return group_connected_components(skeleton.dependency_graph)
    elif strategy == "group_by_architectural_layer":
        # Group by detected layers (routes, models, services, etc.)
        return group_by_detected_patterns(skeleton.file_purposes)
```

#### **Pass 3: Pattern & DNA Analysis (Architectural Understanding)**
*Purpose: Deep analysis of coding patterns and architectural decisions*

```python
# Process architectural groups together
architectural_groups = {
    "routing_layer": [files for routing and API endpoints],
    "data_layer": [files for models and database],
    "auth_layer": [files for authentication and security],
    "business_logic": [files for core business logic]
}

repository_dna = {}
for layer_name, files in architectural_groups.items():
    layer_analysis = await baml_client.AnalyzeArchitecturalLayer(
        layer_name=layer_name,
        files=files,
        relationship_context=relationship_graph,
        structural_context=repository_skeleton
    )
    repository_dna[layer_name] = layer_analysis
```

#### **Pass 4: Contract Synthesis (Final Intelligence)**
*Purpose: Create coherent contracts with full context*

```python
# Synthesize everything into master and sub-contracts
final_contracts = await baml_client.SynthesizeRepositoryContracts(
    structural_skeleton=repository_skeleton,
    relationship_graph=relationship_graph, 
    repository_dna=repository_dna,
    architectural_analysis=architectural_groups_analysis
)
```

### üß† Dynamic Contract Evolution During Processing

#### Real-Time Contract Updates:

```python
class ContractBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.master_contract = MasterContract()
        self.sub_contracts = {}
        self.confidence_scores = {}
        
    async def process_discovery_batch(self, batch):
        # Update structural understanding
        new_structure = await analyze_structure(batch)
        self.master_contract.update_structure(new_structure)
        
    async def process_relationship_batch(self, batch):
        # Update relationship understanding
        new_relationships = await analyze_relationships(batch)
        
        # CRITICAL: Check if new relationships change previous understanding
        for relationship in new_relationships:
            affected_contracts = self.find_affected_contracts(relationship)
            for contract in affected_contracts:
                await self.revise_contract(contract, relationship)
                
    async def revise_contract(self, contract_id, new_information):
        """Retroactively update contract based on new findings"""
        current_contract = self.sub_contracts[contract_id]
        
        # Use BAML to intelligently merge new information
        revised_contract = await baml_client.ReviseContract(
            existing_contract=current_contract,
            new_information=new_information,
            revision_reason="new_relationship_discovered"
        )
        
        self.sub_contracts[contract_id] = revised_contract
        self.confidence_scores[contract_id] = revised_contract.confidence
```

### üöÄ Advanced: Context-Aware Batch Ordering

#### Intelligent Processing Order:

```python
def determine_optimal_processing_order(repository_skeleton):
    """
    Use BAML to determine the best order to process files
    for maximum context accumulation
    """
    return await baml_client.OptimizeProcessingOrder(
        file_structure=repository_skeleton,
        processing_constraints={
            "max_batch_size": 25000,  # tokens
            "relationship_preservation": "high",
            "context_accumulation": "progressive"
        }
    )

# Example output:
processing_plan = {
    "phase_1_foundation": ["README.md", "setup.py", "main.py"],  # Understanding project purpose
    "phase_2_architecture": ["config/", "core/", "__init__.py"],  # Understanding structure  
    "phase_3_business_logic": ["services/", "models/", "handlers/"],  # Understanding functionality
    "phase_4_integration": ["api/", "routes/", "middleware/"],  # Understanding interfaces
    "phase_5_supporting": ["tests/", "docs/", "examples/"]  # Understanding usage patterns
}
```

### üí° BAML Functions for Dynamic Contract Building

#### Contract Revision Function:
```python
function ReviseContract(
    existing_contract: string,
    new_information: string,
    revision_reason: string
) -> RevisedContract {
    client "CustomGPT4o"
    prompt #"
        You are revising a repository contract based on new information discovered.
        
        EXISTING CONTRACT:
        {{ existing_contract }}
        
        NEW INFORMATION:
        {{ new_information }}
        
        REVISION REASON:
        {{ revision_reason }}
        
        TASK:
        1. Identify what aspects of the existing contract need updating
        2. Integrate new information without losing existing insights
        3. Maintain consistency across all contract sections
        4. Update confidence scores for affected sections
        5. Flag any conflicts that need human review
        
        {{ ctx.output_format }}
    "#
}
```

#### Cross-Batch Relationship Discovery:
```python
function DiscoverCrossBatchRelationships(
    processed_contracts: string[],
    current_batch_analysis: string
) -> CrossBatchInsights {
    client "CustomGPT4o"
    prompt #"
        Analyze this new batch in context of already processed contracts.
        
        PREVIOUSLY PROCESSED:
        {{ processed_contracts }}
        
        CURRENT BATCH ANALYSIS:
        {{ current_batch_analysis }}
        
        DISCOVER:
        1. New relationships between current batch and previous batches
        2. Patterns that span across multiple batches
        3. Architectural insights that only become clear with this new context
        4. Contracts that need revision based on new understanding
        
        {{ ctx.output_format }}
    "#
}
```

### üéØ Efficient Implementation Strategy

#### Memory-Efficient Processing:

```python
class ProgressiveRepositoryAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context_accumulator = ContextAccumulator(max_size="50MB")
        self.contract_store = ContractStore()
        
    async def analyze_repository(self, repo_path):
        # Pass 1: Quick structural mapping (lightweight)
        skeleton = await self.map_structure(repo_path)
        
        # Pass 2: Smart relationship analysis (medium cost)
        relationships = await self.analyze_relationships(skeleton)
        
        # Pass 3: Deep pattern analysis (expensive but focused)
        patterns = await self.extract_patterns(skeleton, relationships)
        
        # Pass 4: Contract synthesis (combines everything)
        contracts = await self.synthesize_contracts(skeleton, relationships, patterns)
        
        return contracts
        
    async def map_structure(self, repo_path):
        """Fast, token-efficient structural mapping"""
        # Process in 50-file chunks, extract only structure
        # Total cost: ~10K tokens for 1000-file repository
        
    async def analyze_relationships(self, skeleton):
        """Context-aware relationship analysis"""
        # Process related files together in smart batches
        # Total cost: ~50K tokens for complex relationships
        
    async def extract_patterns(self, skeleton, relationships):
        """Deep pattern and DNA analysis"""
        # Process architectural layers with full context
        # Total cost: ~100K tokens for comprehensive understanding
```

### üèÜ Benefits of Multi-Pass Architecture:

‚úÖ **Relationship Preservation**: Files processed together with their dependencies  
‚úÖ **Progressive Understanding**: Each pass builds on previous knowledge  
‚úÖ **Dynamic Updates**: Contracts evolve as understanding deepens  
‚úÖ **Token Efficiency**: Smart batching minimizes redundant processing  
‚úÖ **Consistency**: Final contracts have complete, coherent understanding  
‚úÖ **Scalability**: Works for repositories of any size  

**This creates repository contracts that truly understand the codebase as a coherent whole, not just a collection of isolated files!**

## üîå Architectural Design Pattern: MCP-like Behavioral Model

### The Contract System as Distributed Intelligence Protocol

The Repository Contract System follows a **behavioral pattern similar to MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, creating an elegant hierarchy for knowledge navigation:

#### **Master Contract = "Server-like Behavior"**
```json

    "entry_points": "Main files to understand the system",

      "routing_system": "API endpoint management info",
      "authentication": "Auth patterns and implementations", 
      "database_layer": "Data access patterns"
    },
    "navigation_hints": "Which contracts to load for different questions"
  }
}
```

**Behavioral Role**: Acts like a **knowledge server** that provides system overview and intelligently routes GPT to the appropriate sub-contracts based on question analysis.

#### **Sub-Contracts = "Tool-like Behavior"**
```json
{
  "routing_system": {
    "detailed_knowledge": "Specific routing patterns and implementation details",
    "file_references": "Exact files and line numbers for routing code", 
    "implementation_recipes": "Step-by-step implementation guidance",
    "nested_subcontracts": ["endpoint_patterns", "middleware_integration"]
  }
}
```

**Behavioral Role**: Acts like a **specialized tool** that provides specific domain capabilities, AND can spawn more granular sub-contracts for deeper knowledge.

#### **Sub-Sub-Contracts = "Nested Capability Behavior"**
```json
{
  "endpoint_patterns": {
    "micro_specialization": "Highly specific implementation patterns",
    "code_examples": "Exact code snippets and modifications",
    "integration_points": "How this connects to other system parts"
  }
}
```

**Behavioral Role**: Provides **micro-specialized knowledge** for very specific implementation details.

### üîÑ GPT Navigation Flow (MCP-Inspired Pattern)

#### **Example: Complex Question Processing**
```
User: "Add JWT authentication with refresh tokens and rate limiting"

GPT Navigation Process:
1. Query Master Contract (always loaded)
   ‚Üí "Complex auth + middleware question"
   ‚Üí "Need: authentication_security + middleware_stack contracts"

2. Load authentication_security sub-contract
   ‚Üí Gets JWT patterns and implementation details
   ‚Üí Confidence: 85%

3. Load middleware_stack sub-contract  
   ‚Üí Gets rate limiting and integration patterns
   ‚Üí Confidence: 90%

4. Question complexity requires deeper knowledge
   ‚Üí Load authentication_security.jwt_refresh_patterns (nested)
   ‚Üí Load middleware_stack.rate_limiting_redis (nested)
   ‚Üí Confidence: 96%

5. Final implementation details needed
   ‚Üí Explore actual files: security/jwt.py, middleware/rate_limit.py
   ‚Üí Confidence: 99%
```

### üå≥ Hierarchical Knowledge Architecture

```
üìã Master Contract (Knowledge Router)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîê authentication_security (Domain Expert)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jwt_patterns (Specialist)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ oauth2_flows (Specialist)  
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session_management (Specialist)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üõ°Ô∏è middleware_stack (Domain Expert)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rate_limiting_patterns (Specialist)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cors_configuration (Specialist)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ request_validation (Specialist)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üåê routing_system (Domain Expert)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ endpoint_patterns (Specialist)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ route_protection (Specialist)
```

### üí° Why This Pattern is Revolutionary

#### **Distributed Intelligence Benefits:**
- **Master Contract**: Provides overview and intelligent routing (like MCP server discovery)
- **Sub-Contracts**: Provide domain expertise on-demand (like specialized tools)
- **Progressive Loading**: Builds understanding incrementally (like tool calling)
- **Hierarchical Access**: Prevents information overload while enabling deep diving

#### **Implementation Elegance:**
```python
class ContractNavigationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.master_contract = self.load_master_contract()  # Always loaded
        self.loaded_subcontracts = {}
        
    async def answer_question(self, question):
        # GPT analyzes question against master contract (server behavior)
        navigation_plan = self.create_navigation_plan(question)
        
        # Load relevant sub-contracts progressively (tool-like behavior)
        for contract_id in navigation_plan.required_contracts:
            contract = self.load_subcontract(contract_id)
            self.loaded_subcontracts[contract_id] = contract
            
            # Nested capability access (nested server behavior)
            if self.needs_deeper_knowledge(question, contract):
                sub_subcontracts = self.load_nested_contracts(contract)
                
        # Synthesize final answer with distributed knowledge
        return self.synthesize_answer(question, self.loaded_subcontracts)
```

#### **Cross-Repository Standardization:**
```python
# Same navigation pattern works for any repository type
async def query_repository_intelligence(repo_type, question):
    master_contract = load_master_contract(repo_type)  # FastAPI, React, Django, etc.
    navigation_plan = analyze_question(question, master_contract)
    
    # Universal pattern for any repository
    for contract in navigation_plan.required_contracts:
        load_domain_contract(contract)
        
    return synthesize_repository_specific_answer()
```

### üéØ Architectural Advantages

#### **1. Intelligent Resource Management**
- **Simple questions**: Master contract only (fast, efficient)
- **Medium questions**: Master + relevant domain contracts (balanced)
- **Complex questions**: Full hierarchical navigation (comprehensive)

#### **2. Behavioral Consistency** 
- **Standardized navigation** across all repository types
- **Predictable knowledge discovery** patterns
- **Consistent interface** for GPT agent interaction

#### **3. Scalable Knowledge Architecture**
- **Unlimited nesting** depth for specialized knowledge
- **Cross-contract references** for related information
- **Dynamic contract loading** based on question complexity
- **Repository-agnostic** behavioral patterns

**This MCP-inspired design creates a universal protocol for repository intelligence that scales from simple questions to complex multi-domain inquiries!**

## ü§ñ Complete Chat Agent Behavioral Cycle

### The Reality: Non-Linear Investigation Process

Real-world repository questions require **iterative investigation**, **multiple thinking checkpoints**, and **adaptive pathways**. The agent doesn't follow a single linear path - it thinks, investigates, reassesses, and pivots based on discoveries.

### üîÑ Agent Investigation Cycle Framework

#### **Phase 1: Question Analysis & Initial Planning**
```python
class ChatAgent:
    async def analyze_question(self, user_question):
        """Initial analysis and planning phase"""
        
        # Step 1: Question Classification
        question_analysis = await self.classify_question(user_question)
        # Output: complexity, domain areas, expected investigation depth
        
        # Step 2: Initial Investigation Plan
        initial_plan = await self.create_investigation_plan(
            question=user_question,
            master_contract=self.master_contract,
            analysis=question_analysis
        )
        
        # Step 3: Confidence Assessment
        confidence_assessment = await self.assess_initial_confidence(initial_plan)
        
        return Investigation(
            plan=initial_plan,
            confidence=confidence_assessment.confidence,
            investigation_paths=confidence_assessment.possible_paths
        )
```

**Example Initial Planning:**
```
User: "How do I add real-time notifications with WebSockets that persist to database?"

Agent Analysis:
- Complexity: HIGH (multiple domains)
- Domains: [websockets, database, real-time, persistence, possibly authentication]
- Investigation Depth: DEEP (will need specific implementation details)
- Initial Confidence: 30% (need significant investigation)

Initial Plan:
1. Load websocket_handling contract
2. Load database_integration contract  
3. Possibly load authentication_security (for user-specific notifications)
4. Will likely need file exploration for implementation details
```

#### **Phase 2: Progressive Contract Investigation**

```python
async def progressive_investigation(self, investigation):
    """Iterative contract loading with thinking checkpoints"""
    
    current_confidence = investigation.confidence
    investigation_log = []
    
    while current_confidence < self.target_confidence:

        current_knowledge = await self.assess_current_knowledge()
        
        # Thinking Checkpoint 2: What's the biggest knowledge gap?
        knowledge_gaps = await self.identify_knowledge_gaps(
            question=investigation.original_question,
            current_knowledge=current_knowledge
        )
        
        # Thinking Checkpoint 3: What's the best next investigation step?
        next_action = await self.decide_next_action(
            knowledge_gaps=knowledge_gaps,
            available_contracts=self.get_available_contracts(),
            current_confidence=current_confidence
        )
        
        # Execute the chosen action
        if next_action.type == "LOAD_CONTRACT":
            result = await self.load_and_analyze_contract(next_action.contract_id)
            current_confidence += result.confidence_boost
            
        elif next_action.type == "QUERY_FAISS":
            result = await self.query_faiss_embeddings(next_action.query_params)
            current_confidence += result.confidence_boost
            
        elif next_action.type == "EXPLORE_FILES":
            result = await self.explore_repository_files(next_action.file_list)
            current_confidence += result.confidence_boost
            
        elif next_action.type == "CROSS_REFERENCE":
            result = await self.cross_reference_contracts(next_action.contracts)
            current_confidence += result.confidence_boost
            
        # Log the investigation step
        investigation_log.append({
            "step": len(investigation_log) + 1,
            "action": next_action,
            "result": result,
            "confidence_before": current_confidence - result.confidence_boost,
            "confidence_after": current_confidence,
            "reasoning": next_action.reasoning
        })
        
        # Thinking Checkpoint 4: Should I pivot the investigation?
        should_pivot = await self.evaluate_pivot_necessity(
            investigation_log=investigation_log,
            confidence_progress=current_confidence,
            original_plan=investigation.plan
        )
        
        if should_pivot.should_pivot:
            investigation.plan = await self.create_pivot_plan(should_pivot.reason)
            
    return InvestigationResult(
        confidence=current_confidence,
        investigation_log=investigation_log,
        final_knowledge=current_knowledge
    )
```

#### **Phase 3: Multi-Path Investigation Examples**

##### **Path A: Straightforward Discovery**
```

Step 8: DONE

Total Steps: 8 | Time: ~2.5 seconds | Path: Discovery-driven with pivot
```

### üß† Agent Thinking Process at Each Checkpoint

#### **Thinking Checkpoint Framework:**
```python
async def thinking_checkpoint(self, context):
    """Agent self-reflection and decision making"""
    
    reflection = await self.reflect_on_progress(
        question=context.original_question,
        investigation_so_far=context.investigation_log,
        current_knowledge=context.current_knowledge,
        confidence=context.current_confidence
    )
    
    # Key Questions the Agent Asks Itself:
    decision_matrix = await self.evaluate_decisions({
        "knowledge_completeness": "Do I understand the main concepts?",
        "implementation_clarity": "Can I provide specific implementation steps?",
        "confidence_level": "Am I confident enough to give accurate guidance?",
        "knowledge_gaps": "What specific information am I still missing?",
        "investigation_efficiency": "Am I investigating efficiently?",
        "pivot_necessity": "Should I change my investigation approach?"
    })
    
    return decision_matrix
```

#### **Example Agent Internal Monologue:**
```
Question: "Add JWT authentication with role-based permissions"

Agent Thinking Process:
---
Initial Analysis: "Complex auth question. Need JWT + RBAC patterns."
Load auth contract ‚Üí "Good JWT patterns, but RBAC unclear"
 
Checkpoint 1: "I understand JWT, but RBAC implementation is vague. 
              Need more specific role management patterns."
              
Load authorization_patterns sub-contract ‚Üí "Found role decorators"
Query FAISS: "role-based access examples" ‚Üí "Found middleware patterns"

Checkpoint 2: "Better understanding of RBAC, but how do JWT + roles integrate?
              Need to see actual implementation."
              
Explore files: ["auth/jwt.py", "auth/roles.py"] ‚Üí "Found integration pattern"

Checkpoint 3: "Clear implementation path now. JWT tokens contain role claims,
              middleware validates roles. Confidence high enough to provide
              specific implementation guidance."
              
DONE: Generate comprehensive implementation plan

    """Dynamic decision making based on current state"""
    
    if context.confidence < 70:

## üéÆ Agent in Action: Live Demonstration

### Real-World Example Using type-fest Repository

To demonstrate how the complete system works in practice, here's a live simulation using the **sindresorhus/type-fest** repository contracts from our earlier analysis.

#### **User Question**: *"How do I create a utility type that converts object keys to camelCase while preserving nested object structure?"*

### Phase 1: Question Analysis & Initial Planning

```
ü§ñ Agent Initial Analysis:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
‚îÇ QUESTION CLASSIFICATION:
‚îÇ - Complexity: MEDIUM-HIGH (custom type creation + nested logic)
‚îÇ - Domain: String manipulation + Object transformation  
‚îÇ - Investigation Depth: DEEP (need specific TypeScript patterns)
‚îÇ - Initial Confidence: 35% (need significant investigation)
‚îÇ
‚îÇ REPOSITORY CONTEXT (from Master Contract):
‚îÇ - type-fest: TypeScript utility library
‚îÇ - Specializes in advanced type transformations
‚îÇ - Has string manipulation utilities (camelCase exists)
‚îÇ - Has object transformation patterns
‚îÇ
‚îÇ INITIAL INVESTIGATION PLAN:
‚îÇ 1. Load string_manipulation contract (camelCase patterns)
‚îÇ 2. Load object_transformation contract (nested object handling)
‚îÇ 3. Likely need template literal type examples
‚îÇ 4. May need to explore actual implementation files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
```

### Phase 2: Progressive Contract Investigation

#### **Investigation Step 1: Load Master Contract**
```
üß† THINKING CHECKPOINT 1: "What do I know about this repository?"

üìã Master Contract Analysis:
- Repository specializes in TypeScript utility types
- Has string_manipulation sub-contract (includes camelCase)
- Has object_transformation sub-contract (object utilities)
- Advanced TypeScript features: template literals, conditional types, mapped types

üí≠ Agent Decision: "This looks like a string + object transformation question. 
   Let me start with string_manipulation since camelCase is mentioned."

‚û°Ô∏è Next Action: LOAD_CONTRACT ‚Üí string_manipulation
   Confidence: 35% ‚Üí 50% (better repository understanding)

    }
  }
}

üß† THINKING CHECKPOINT 2: "Great! I found camelCase implementation. But I need 
   to understand how to apply it to object KEYS, not just strings. The current 
   CamelCase type works on strings, but I need key transformation."

üí≠ Agent Decision: "I understand string camelCase conversion, but missing the 
   object key transformation part. Need object utilities."

‚û°Ô∏è Next Action: LOAD_CONTRACT ‚Üí object_transformation

üîç Exploring files: source/camel-case.d.ts, source/object-utilities.d.ts

üìÅ File Analysis:
source/camel-case.d.ts (lines 5-20):
```typescript
export type CamelCase<S extends string> = S extends `${infer P1}_${infer P2}${infer P3}`
  ? `${P1}${Uppercase<P2>}${CamelCase<P3>}`

  [K in keyof T as K extends string ? U : K]: T[K]
}
```

üß† THINKING CHECKPOINT 5: "Perfect! Now I have the exact patterns. I can 
   combine CamelCase<string> with mapped type key transformation for objects, 
   and add recursion for nested objects."

### Phase 3: Answer Generation

```
ü§ñ AGENT RESPONSE:

Based on type-fest's patterns, here's how to create a utility type that converts 
object keys to camelCase while preserving nested structure:

## Implementation

```typescript
// Step 1: Use type-fest's CamelCase for string conversion
import type {CamelCase} from 'type-fest';

// Step 2: Create the nested object key transformer
type CamelCaseKeys<T> = {
  [K in keyof T as K extends string ? CamelCase<K> : K]: T[K] extends object
    ? T[K] extends any[]
      ? T[K] // Keep arrays as-is
      : CamelCaseKeys<T[K]> // Recursively transform nested objects
    : T[K]
}

// Step 3: Usage example
type Example = CamelCaseKeys<{
  user_name: string;
  user_settings: {
    theme_color: string;
    notification_enabled: boolean;
  };
  item_list: string[];
}>;

// Result:
// {
//   userName: string;
//   userSettings: {
//     themeColor: string;
//     notificationEnabled: boolean;
//   };
//   itemList: string[];
// }
```

## How it works (based on type-fest patterns):

1. **Key Remapping**: Uses mapped types with `as` clause (pattern from object-utilities.d.ts)
2. **String Conversion**: Leverages existing CamelCase type (from camel-case.d.ts)  
3. **Recursive Logic**: Handles nested objects with conditional types
4. **Array Preservation**: Keeps arrays intact while transforming object keys

This implementation follows type-fest's architectural patterns:
- Uses existing utilities as building blocks
- Employs recursive conditional types
- Maintains type safety with proper generic constraints

CONFIDENCE: 97% - Implementation ready for production use.
